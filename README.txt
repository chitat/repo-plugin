This plugin adds Repo (http://code.google.com/p/git-repo/) as an SCM
provider for Jenkins.  Projects can use this plugin to run builds only
when pull request or push is created in any of the git repositories
in the repo manifest. 

After build, build info can be published back into the pull request issue,
or the push commit. Developer can clearly see the build status of each
push commit, and/or pull request.
